One of the most important thing I thought about when writing my paper was to pick a topic that I liked and would enjoy writing about and it happened to be one of the most useful device I have; my iPhone. The next thing I did was re-read the instruction given for the paper so I can come up with a strategy on exactly how to approach my research.  I begin my search by searching information I have some knowledge of then as I come up on new information, I expand my search. I write down key information I find. I make notes in a manner that can prevent plagiarism and make note of my references. When I gather all the information that I want to use, I chose start writing my thesis, highlighting what I want to talk about on my paper. Once I got the thesis done, I start writing my rough draft, occasionally going back and conducting more research to support my arguments. One I read my rough draft and make my adjustments, I write my paper.
